# Governance

The Governance Committee exists to promote transparent collaboration within the network and provide neutral discussions on proposals, voting, and governance issues. We work closely together with validators and other committees to ensure optimal support for the overarching Secret Network goals.&#x20;

It is vital to provide a space where thoughts and ideas can freely and respectfully be exchanged by anyone within the Secret Network to aid in reaching informed consensus on-chain.&#x20;

The Governance committee lead is Pmuecke | SecretSauce which you can contact via the #Governance discord channel. The Governance committee hosts a meeting every Wednesday at 1400 UTC and posts weekly meeting notes on the [forum](https://forum.scrt.network/t/governance-meeting-notes-mega-thread/3946/41).
