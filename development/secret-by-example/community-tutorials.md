## Secret Network Tutorials

This page is dedicated to community tutorials and code repositories that provide helpful references for writing Secret Network contracts as well as building full-stack Secret Networks dApps.&#x20;

To follow a guided walk-through on configuring your development environment, please visit the [Getting Started](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/getting-started) documentation page.

### Secret University

Learn to build on Secret Network with [Secret University](https://scrt.university/pathways) and dive deep into the code with [Secret University Boxes](https://scrt.university/repositories), which are pre-built, preconfigured dApp templates built on Secret Network. Each Secret Box runs in its own sandbox developer environment and comes preconfigured with a simple UI kit.&#x20;

### Developing Your First Secret Contract

Refer to this [tutorial](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/docs/blob/main/docs/dev/learn-by-doing-tutorial1.md) from `darwinzer0` about developing a Secret Exploding Message app with practical insights on Secret Contract functions, messages, and storage.

### Simple Secret Voting App

Use [this link](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretSimpleVote/blob/master/src/contract.rs) to see a sample voting contract and a line-by-line description of everything you need to know.

### Secret Sealed Bid Auction

Use [this link](https://github.com/baedrik/SCRT-sealed-bid-auction) for a sealed-bid (secret) auction contract that makes use of [SNIP-20](https://github.com/scrtlabs/snip20-reference-impl) and a walkthrough of the contract.

For an even more advanced version of this stunning Secret Sealed Bid Auction app, you can refer to its enhanced [Secret Auction Factory](https://github.com/baedrik/secret-auction-factory) put in production.

The VueJS UI code is available [here](https://github.com/stakeordie/scrt-auction).

### Secret Ethereum Bridge

The source code of the Harmony-based Ethereum bridge frontend is available [here](https://github.com/scrtlabs/EthereumBridgeFrontend).

If you are interested to know how to programmatically use the bridge, you can look at the [manual swap](https://github.com/scrtlabs/EthereumBridge#manual-swap) section of the Ethereum Bridge doc.
