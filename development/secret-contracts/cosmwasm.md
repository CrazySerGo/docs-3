# CosmWasm

Secret Network smart contracts, or Secret Contracts, are WebAssembly applications that run on the Secret Network blockchain.&#x20;

The framework used to develop Secret Contracts is called CosmWasm. This framework is not unique to Secret Network - it was developed by the amazing folks at [Confio](https://confio.gmbh/), and is widely across the Cosmos ecosystem.&#x20;

Luckily for us, [CosmWasm has amazing documentation](https://book.cosmwasm.com/), so we suggest referring there for all things CosmWasm.&#x20;

The documentation pages found here will focus on high-level guidance in addition to the unique modifications and features that Secret Network has to offer beyond your run-of-the-mill Cosmos chain.
