# CosmWasm

Secret Network smart contracts, or Secret Contracts, are WebAssembly applications that run on the Secret Network blockchain.

The framework used to develop Secret Contracts is called CosmWasm. This framework is not unique to Secret Network - it was developed by the amazing folks at [Confio](https://confio.gmbh/), and is used widely across the Cosmos ecosystem.

Luckily for us, [CosmWasm has amazing documentation](https://book.cosmwasm.com/), so we suggest referring there for all things CosmWasm.

The documentation pages found here will focus on high-level guidance, in addition to the unique modifications and features that Secret Network offers as the privacy hub of the Cosmos.&#x20;
